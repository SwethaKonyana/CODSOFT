I have successfully completed 3 tasks provided by #CODSOFT i.e. simple calculator, password generator, weather forecast by using PYTHON languge.

TASK 2: CALCULATOR:-

I designed this simple calculator by using python which performs basic arithmetic operations. In this task when the user selected the choice then it performs the calculation and display the result.

TASK 3: PASSWORD GENERATOR:-

In this task I designed this password generator application by using python it is useful tool which generates strong and random passwords for users.It allows users to specify the length and complexity of the password.
It uses a combination of random characters to generate a password of the specified length.Finally it displays the generated password on the screen.

TASK 4: WEATHER FORECAST:-

I developed this weather forecast application using python. This application involves retrieving weather data from an API and presenting it in a user-friendly format.
The user need to enter the name of the city or a zip code, then it makes an API requests to retrieve weather data based on the users input, finally it displays the retrieved weather information to the user in a user-friendly format.
